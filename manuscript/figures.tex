	coordinates are $x_{k}$ and $y_{l}$, where the $k = 1, \dots, N_{x}$ and $l = 1, \dots, N_{y}$ are 
	called the grid indices. The insets show the grid indices $k$ and $l$.}

%% Synthetic data part I

\plot{synthetic_data_comparison_v2}{width=\textwidth}{
{Synthetic tests: the simulated airborne magnetic surveys  - 
The first row shows the grids of observation points or the undulating observation surfaces that simulate the airborne magnetic surveys. 
The second row shows the noise-corrupted total-field anomalies produced by the synthetic sources and calculated on the simulated airborne magnetic survey shown in the first row. 
The third row shows the  noise-free total-field anomalies produced by the synthetic sources 
at $z = −1,300$ m (the true upward-continued total-field anomalies).
The results shown in these three rows were obtained by using the simulated airborne magnetic surveys as follows: 
(a) A regular grid of $100 \times 50$ observation points in the $x-$ and $y-$directions and a flat observation surface at $900$ m height. 
(b) A irregular grid with uncertainty of $20\%$  in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and a flat observation surface at $900$ m height. 
(c) A irregular grid with uncertainty of $30\%$  in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and a flat observation surface at $900$ m height. 
(d) A regular grid  of $100 \times 50$ observation points in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and an undulating observation surface with uncertainty of $5\%$. 
(e) A regular grid  of $100 \times 50$ observation points in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and an undulating observation surface with uncertainty of $10\%$.

the noise-free total-field anomaly produced by the synthetic sources at $z = −1,300$ m

the predicted total-field anomaly at $z = −1,300$ m  obtained by using three methods:
the classical method (first row); the convolutional equivalent layer (second row); and 
the classic approach in the Fourier domain (third row).
