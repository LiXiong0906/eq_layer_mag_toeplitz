The data residuals of the reduced to pole total-field anomalies are defined as the difference between the noise-free total-field anomaly produced by the synthetic sources at the pole (fourth row in Figure \ref {fig:synthetic_data_comparison_v2}) and the predicted total-field anomaly obtained by using three methods: the classical method (first row); the convolutional equivalent layer (second row); and the classic approach in the Fourier domain (third row). The results shown in these three rows were obtained by using the simulated airborne magnetic surveys shown in Figure \ref {fig:synthetic_data_comparison_v2}, i.e.: (a) A regular grid of $100 \times 50$ observation points in the $x-$ and $y-$directions and a flat observation surface at $z= -900$ m. An irregular grid with uncertainties of (b) $20\%$ and (c) $30\%$ in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and a flat observation surface at $z= - 900$ m . A regular grid of $100 \times 50$ observation points in the $x-$ and $y-$coordinates and an undulating observation surface with uncertainties of (d) $5\%$ and (e) $10\%$. The black lines represent the horizontal projection of the sources }{figure.caption.32}{}}
